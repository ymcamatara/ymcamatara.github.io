# **UPGRADE SPECIFICATION: JSON/Markdown Data & Date Filtering**

## **1\. Data Structure Transition**

Please migrate the content system from description.txt to the following:

* **info.json**: This file will store metadata for each programme.  
  * Required attributes: "title", "date" (Format: YYYY-MM-DD), and "description" (A short summary for the preview card).  
* **article.md**: This file will store the full-length article content using Markdown (supporting headers, lists, and bold text).

## **2\. Python Script Logic Updates (build\_site.py)**

Update the build script to:

* **Parse JSON**: Read the title, date, and description from info.json.  
* **Markdown Conversion**: Use the markdown library to convert article.md into HTML for the individual programme pages.  
* **Card Generation**: In news.html, the card for each programme must now:  
  * Display the title and the short description from the JSON.  
  * Include data attributes for filtering: data-year (extracted from the date string) and data-month (the month name or number).  
* **Sorting**: Ensure programmes are sorted on the news.html page by date (newest first).

## **3\. Calendar Filter UI & Logic**

On the news.html page, implement the following:

* **Filter UI**: Add two \<select\> dropdowns:  
  1. **Year**: Automatically populated with the unique years found in your programmes.  
  2. **Month**: A list of months (January–December).  
  * Both must include an "All" option.  
* **JavaScript Filter**:  
  * Write a clean JavaScript function that listens for changes on these dropdowns.  
  * It should toggle the visibility (display: block/none) of the programme cards based on the data-year and data-month attributes.  
  * **Best Practice**: If no cards match the selection, show a centered message: "No programmes found for this selected period."

## **4\. Design Integration**

* Style the Markdown output in the generated sub-pages so that bullet points and headers have proper spacing.  
* Ensure the filter dropdowns are styled with YMCA colors (Blue: \#004a99) and are easy to tap on mobile devices.
